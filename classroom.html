  <h6> “There’s a sailboat on the Hudson” </h6>
<hr>
<div class="blurb">            
<p>The Hudson River is named for the European explorer Henry Hudson, who explored it in 1609. Hudson was looking for a passing to the Asia when he discovered the river. In 1524, the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano first entered the Hudson but mistook it for an estuary.</p>
<p>The Hudson River flows both North and South. Near the Atlantic, the river flows north, and near its origin in Lake Tear of the Clouds, it flows south.</p>
<p>The Native American tribe of the Iroquois called the river Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk also known as the Great Mohegan. It actually means "the water that moves both ways".</p>
<p>Before the river was explored by Henry Hudson (traveling for the Dutch East India Company), the river was used for travel by the Native Americans.</p>
<p>The Hudson River valley played an important role during the French and Indian war in 1750s and the American Revolutionary war. In the 1750s, the British army made the Northern part of the Hudson Valley their defense against the invading French from Quebec.</p>
<p>During Colonial times from the 17th century to 1776, the Hudson River supported a very important and profitable fur trade. The Hudson Valley at this time was used for wheat and timber, which was taken to New York and from there made its way to the entire western world.</p>
<p>The Dutch occupied New York State and settled in two cities on the Hudson. One was called Nieuw Amsterdam, which is now New York City, and the other was Beverwyck, which is today the state capital (Albany).</p>
<p>The major cities along the Hudson include Troy, Hudson, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Peekskill and Yonkers in New York, and Weehawken, Hoboken and Jersey City in the state of New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Hudson is surrounded by incredible beauty. In fact, so much so that it was nicknamed "America's Rhine" because it was being compared to the popular area surrounding the German Rhine River.</p>
<p>Another name for the southernmost portion of the Hudson is the North River. This refers to the area between Manhattan and Hudson County. Tapan Zee is the widest part of the river.</p>
  
<h4> The Industrial Revolution to Today </h4>
<p> The Erie Canal opened in 1825 and connected Lake Erie in the Great Lakes region to the Hudson and onward to Europe. The cost of moving goods was reduced as well as the time it took to transport them. This was very important for America as it created an increase in the trade of goods and gave the economy a big boost. </p>
<p> Inventor Robert Fulton started a new age of navigation when he piloted his North River Steamboat on the Hudson. Later, the boat was to be called the "Clermont".</p>
<p>Railroads were built along the Hudson in the 1850s, which increased the number of tourists in the area greatly. The Hudson River Rail Road was built along the shores of the river, and travelers could see the amazing beauty surrounding the river like never before.</p>
<p>Many artists and writers would try and capture the beauty in their art as well as in poetry and stories. Collectively, they formed the Hudson River School and included artists such as Thomas Cole, Asher B. Durand, and Frederick Church. These artists created marvelous paintings of the natural beauty surrounding the Hudson, which was then sold in New York art galleries. The first internationally known American author, Washington Irving, drew his inspiration from the Hudson and wrote many stories about the people and the places surrounding the Hudson.</p>
<p>The Tapan Zee Bridge is the longest bridge crossing the Hudson, which links South Nyack and Tarrytown in New York State. Tappan is the name of a Native American tribe that lived near the Hudson while Zee comes from the Dutch word for "wide expanse of water".</p>
<p>People traveling from the state of New Jersey use the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) system, which is a subway-like rail system connecting New Jersey with Manhattan. The PATH system runs beneath the Hudson.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Tunnel is an old tunnel under the Hudson connecting 42nd Street in Manhattan with Weehawken in New Jersey.</p>
<p>West Point is the oldest military academy in the United States that started in 1802 and is situated along the Hudson.</p>

  <h6> "‘Neath the great cliffs of the Palisades" </h6>
<hr>
      
            <div class="blurb">            
<p> The Palisades, basalt bluffs 200–540 feet (60–165 metres) high along  northeastern New Jersey, U.S. Rising vertically from near the water’s edge, they are characterized by uplifts, faults, and columnar structure developed by slow cooling of molten material near the end of the Triassic Period (245 to 208 million years ago). The Palisades Interstate Park Commission, established in 1900 and headquartered in Bear Mountain, New York, oversees 24 park units, occupying a total area of 150 square miles (388 square km), in New York and New Jersey. Linking the various units is the 42-mile (68-kilometre) Palisades Interstate Parkway, extending northward from George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee, New Jersey, to Bear Mountain Bridge, New York. The largest unit is Harriman State Park (73 square miles [189 square km]). Facilities for hiking, swimming, fishing, boating, camping, picnicking, golfing, rock climbing, and skating are available. An inn is open all year long at Bear Mountain.
<p>The term Palisades, now quasi-generic for a line of cliffs, was apparently first used in reference to these columnar formations along the Hudson.</p>

 <div class="blurb">                       
<h4 class="special"> NJ and the revolutionary war </h4>
<p> Besides being the location of several important battles, New Jersey was also helpful in disrupting British supply units. Forts on the Delaware River could attack British supply troops as they sailed to Philadelphia. Men in whaleboats crossed the Hudson and raided New York City and Long Island, and captured shipping in the Sandy Hook staging area outside New York Harbor. Ships based in south Jersey ports raided British shipping at sea. New Jersey also had several ironworks that provide iron and iron products, such as cannon, for the war effort, besides its food production. The Ford family in Morristown ran a black powder mill that supplied needed powder for the early war effort. The Continental army encamped three years in New Jersey, in the winters of 1777 at Morristown, 1778-79 at Middlebrook (near Bound Brook), and in 1780 again at Morristown. Large parts of the Continental forces wintered in other years in NJ. Raids from British held New York City across the Hudson into New Jersey happened very frequently. The British sent men into New Jersey looking for supplies, firewood, cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, and looking to capture leading patriots. </p>

  <h6>"You’re the voice of Thomas Edison"</h6>
<hr>
  <div class="blurb">            
          
<p>Thomas Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park",[3] he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[4]</p>
<p>Edison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries world-wide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures.</p>
<p>His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution[5] to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world.</p>

<hr>
  <div class="blurb">            
          
<p> A poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass,[1] revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.  Walt Whitman made his home in Camden New Jersey from 1873 until his death. </p>

  <h6>"and Salem’s Oak"</h6>
<hr>
     <div class="blurb">            
       
<p>The Great Salem Oak was already mature when John Fenwick signed his treaty with the Lenni Lenape Indians to start the Quaker Settlement there in 1753. It was honored during the town’s 325th Anniversary.
The following tablet about the tree is located on the brick wall surrounding the burial ground.
A historical marker about the Salem Oak Tree is located just outside the burial ground. The marker was placed by the Salem County Cultural and Heritage Commission and it reads as follows:
Salem Oak Tree. Most famous New Jersey tree stands in a cemetery. By tradition, John Fenwick made his treaty with the Indians in its shade, 1675.
There is probably no historic site in Salem County better known than the Salem Oak. It has been celebrated in poetry and prose for over a century, and incorporated as a symbol of the county by both private and public enterprises.
Unlike any other local landmark, the oak is a living reminder of the county’s history. Estimated to be more than 400 years old, this ancient tree is said to have shaded the Lenni Lenape, and local lore maintains that John Fenwick treatied with Native Americans beneath its branches upon his arrival here in 1675. What is certain is that the Religious Society of Friends, Salem Monthly Meeting, has owned the tree and surrounding property since 1681. This was the site of Salem’s first meetinghouse and is still maintained as the Friends Burial Ground. The Friends Meeting cares for the grounds and the tree to this very day.</p>

  <h4 class="special">Princeton</h4>
<p> Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the College of New Jersey, Princeton was the fourth chartered institution of higher education in the American colonies [6][a] and thus one of the nine Colonial Colleges established before the American Revolution. The institution moved to Newark in 1747, then to the current site nine years later, where it was renamed Princeton University in 1896.[11] The present-day College of New Jersey in nearby Ewing Township, New Jersey, is an unrelated institution. Princeton had close ties to the Presbyterian Church, but has never been affiliated with any denomination[12] and today imposes no religious requirements on its students.[b]</p>
<p>Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[14] It does not have schools of medicine, law, divinity, education, or business, but it offers professional degrees through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Theological Seminary, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[c] Princeton has been associated with 37 Nobel laureates, 17 National Medal of Science winners, two Abel Prize winners, eight Fields Medalists (more so than any other university), nine Turing Award laureates, three National Humanities Medal recipients and 204 Rhodes Scholars.</p>

  <h6>“spirits walk through Princeton’s halls”</h6> 
<hr>
<div class="blurb">            
            <p> An allusion to the spirit of Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist and philosopher of science.[3] 
Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.</p>

<p><strong>Fact #1: Einstein wasn't a beautiful baby.</strong> When Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, the back of his head was reportedly so huge that his family worried something was wrong with him. But within the first few weeks, the shape of his head became more normal-looking.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #2: Einstein was slow to talk.</strong> Some say he didn't start speaking until age four. Stanford economist Dr. Thomas Sowell even coined the controversial term "Einstein Syndrome" to describe exceptionally bright people whose speech is delayed.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #3: Einstein did NOT flunk math.</strong> It's long been rumored that Einstein was a bad student -- and these rumors have been fueled in part by headlines like one in a "Ripley's Believe it or Not!" newspaper: "Greatest living mathematician failed in mathematics." In fact, Einstein was not a poor student. He was conversant in college physics before he was 11 years old, was a ''brilliant'' violin player, and received high marks in Latin and Greek. Before age 15 he had already mastered calculus.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #4: Einstein set weird rules for his wife.</strong> Einstein demanded a lot from Mileva. In fact, he gave her a set of rules to follow. Included on the list was that she had to serve three meals day, to stop talking if he asked her to, and to expect no romance from him.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #5: Einstein got along really well with his cousin.</strong> So well, in fact, that she -- Elsa Einstein -- became his wife in 1919.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #6: Wearing socks wasn't Einstein's thing.</strong> In another letter to Elsa, Einstein wrote that he "got away without wearing socks" at the University of Oxford. The world-renowned genius eventually became known for his unkempt appearance -- though more attention was focused on his hair than on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #7: Einstein was a member of the NAACP.</strong> Specifically, the chapter in Princeton, N.J., where he lived and worked. But even before Einstein moved permanently to America in 1933, he corresponded with civil rights activist and scholar W.E.B. Dubois, a founder of the NAACP. And during a 1946 speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, Einstein called racism “a disease," the Harvard Gazette reported.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #8: Einstein may have hastened his death.</strong> Einstein died on April 18, 1955 after suffering a burst blood vessel. According to the website of the American Museum of Natural History, doctors suggested surgery, but Einstein declined, saying, "It is tasteless to prolong life artificially."</p>
